# Feedback from Code Review

Hello fellow coders!

I've successfully completed a code review meeting and received valuable feedback from **Amal Shehu**. Here's how I tackled it:

## Before Code Review
  - The reviewed problem was [sherlock and anagrams](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-anagrams/problem)  
  - This was my solution before the code review : [click here](./sherlock_and_anagrams/src/old.rs)

## Feedback Summary: 
  - The feedback I received from Amal Shehu suggested that I should refactor my code to improve its readability. Amal recommended using more comments and giving meaningful names to variables. Additionally, he suggested testing each line of code and optimizing the logic to achieve the solution with minimal code.

## Implementation: 
  - I added more comments explaing every line of my code. 
  - I renamed the variables to more meaningfull names.
  - By running multiple tests i was able remove an if statement from my code. This significanly increased the runtime speed. 

## Contributors:
  - I would like to extend a special thanks to **Amal Shehu** for their invaluable feedback. He carefully reviewed every line of my code and were able to identify improvements that could enhance its readability and optimization.. 

## Impact: 
  - After incorporating all the suggested improvements and changes, my code became easier to read and understand without needing further explanation. Additionally, after the refactor, my code became more optimized and faster..
  - This was my solution after naking the improvements : [click here](./sherlock_and_anagrams/src/main.rs)
